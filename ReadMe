The "MovieTrailerWebsite" generates a Website viewable in any Webbrowser. It
lists Luds favourite Movies.
Each entry will display a picture linking to the trailer on YouTube and display
some additional information to the movie.

The generator is written in Python using version 2.7.10.

In order to generate the above mentioned website run "entertainment_center.py".
If you are running macOS this can be done as follows:
- open the Terminal
- type in $ python 
- drag and drop the entertainment_center.py file into the terminal window, which
    will give you something like:
    $ python Volumes/SSD/Users/.../MovieTrailerWebsite/entertainment_center.py
- hit enter
- the website will automatically be opened in your standard webbrowser


The following files are included:
1) media.py
    defines all necessary classes, which are
        a) Video
        b) Movie
2) entertainment_center.py
    contains a list of all movies and series
    executes the files fresh_tomatoes.py
3) fresh_tomatoes.py
    - receives the list of all movies from file 2) and generates a html site
    - opens the generated website in default webbroswer

Additional Notes:
The class Video() seems to be not necessary. It is intended for adding further
classes that are video material but not movies, such as series. This indeed is
used in the branch series-feature. So far the series-feature can not be
merged into the master branch due to some error which is stated in the ReadMe
of the sub-branch.
